The master council of 5 worlds (known as pillars) that keep [[README|the Atlas]] in balance. If any of the worlds that make up the Atlas lose their cogency, the pace and coherency of the current [[round]] becomes erratic. This subsequently threatens the surity of the Atlas' emergence into the next pulse.

This is not to say that worlds cannot lose their coherency or become derelict; quite the opposite is often true. Plenty of pillars fall into dormancy or disrepair, it is when the world itself is being threatened with true erasure or chronological corruption that stewards of the Atlas should find cause for alarm.
