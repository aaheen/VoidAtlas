**Void Atlas** is a collaborative worldbuilding project started by [Erik Heen](https://heen.dev) in June 2022. Other early contributors were Ryan Studham, Ally Studham, and Gabe Robertson. Heavily inspired by the cosmere from Brandon Sanderson's *Stormlight Archives*, it's mainly comprised of 19 (inhabited) planets, one star, six nebulae, the anomaly aka the heart, and two void beasts.
