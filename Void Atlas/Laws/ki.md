**Ki** (sometimes spelled `chi`) is the term for all ambient thought or consciousness that permeates all matter, or a kind of spirit energy. Ki is similar to physical energy in that it can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.

## Condensation
As ki becomes more concentrated around an area in physical space, it condenses into [[mana]]. ([[mana condensation|read more]])
