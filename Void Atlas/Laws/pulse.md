The history of [[README|the Atlas]] is split up into eras of irregular length called pulses. Each pulse, all worlds pass through [[The Heart]] almost or absolutely simultaneously, and emerge again "after". Describing it as "after" is a subject hotly debated by the scholars of each age. Upon emerging into a new pulse, any surviving records of the immutable timekeepers (the stars) completely contradict the sky as it exists, with no recognizable constellations there. However, for the contiguous timespace of each pulse, the stars can be used to perfectly indicate the time, down to microsecond precision.
