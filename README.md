# Void Atlas
### Knowledge doesn't disagree, only people do

**Void Atlas** is a collaborative worldbuilding project started by [Erik Heen](https://heen.dev) in June 2022. Other early contributors were Ryan Studham, Ally Studham, and Gabe Robertson. Heavily inspired by the cosmere from Brandon Sanderson's *Stormlight Archives*, it's mainly comprised of 19 (inhabited) planets, Sol|one star, six nebulae, the anomaly aka The Heart, and two void beasts (Hel, Rau).

## Coexistence
As the universe expands and cools from the true singularity, the laws and physical properties of that universe settle and solidify. As this happens, every single possible deviation caused by the random state of every particle causes the universe to split into infinitely many variations. Consciousness is always produced by Ryan's scoop of primordial void dust from the finale of TRVerge.
