# Void Atlas
### Knowledge doesn't disagree, only people do

**Void Atlas** is a collaborative worldbuilding project started by [Erik Heen](https://heen.dev) in June 2022. Other early contributors were Ryan Studham, Ally Studham, and Gabe Robertson. Heavily inspired by the cosmere from Brandon Sanderson's *Stormlight Archives*, it's mainly comprised of 19 (inhabited) planets, [[Sol|one star]], 
six nebulae, the anomaly aka [[The Heart]], and two [[void beast]]s ([[Hel]], [[Rau]]).

# Collaboration
### It's a big grab bag

The following folders are just places to chuck ideas that you have that you feel like explicitly sharing, or writing down but you're not sure if they fit into your current project. Anyone is free to copy things from these folders into their own projects:

- `Character`
- `City`
- `Dungeon`
- `Event`
- `Group`
- `Item`
- `Lore`  (i.e. stories, legends, ancient tales)
- `Nation` (kingdoms, states, nations, i.e. any group of people that principally inhabits a specific territory, or any large shared identity)

Ideally, you would be modifying any really significant items at least very slightly so there isn't straight up duplicate content in different worlds. 

## Crossovers
However, this is also an opportunity to have crossover events, if a given `$thing` *is* actually duplicated, but obviously it'd be good to discuss any crossovers with the person you're trying to have a shared piece of content with.

## Coexistence
As the universe expands and cools from the true singularity, the laws and physical properties of that universe settle and solidify. As this happens, every single possible deviation caused by the random state of every particle causes the universe to split into infinitely many variations. Consciousness is always produced by Ryan's scoop of primordial void dust from the finale of TRVerge.
