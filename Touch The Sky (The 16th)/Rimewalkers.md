Academics. Their eagerness to teach is matched only by their enthusiasm to learn. To fund archaeological expeditions, they open academies on-site for anyone who can keep up with the rapid pace of lessons. They use violence as a last resort. When a candidate walks from island to island by freezing the water beneath them, a feat requiring incredible patience and focus, they graduate from student to faculty. They habitually distrust traditional methods, and refuse to associate with Levinspeakers for their unwillingness to innovate. Raxo, a former Levinspeaker, leads the organization.
