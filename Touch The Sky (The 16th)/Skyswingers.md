Guns-for-hire. Independents that will watch each others' backs even without a reason. Skill with grappling hooks gets them across a city in under a minute. They serve mostly themselves, though they tend to be fast to make new friends. Though they have no leader, Mordecai taught much of the current generation. They have no patience for beaurocracy, and as such hate Levinspeakers almost universally.
