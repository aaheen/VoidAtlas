The Sixteenth is on an very fast comet-like orbit, bringing it extremely close to and extremely far from [[Sol|Romo]]. This dramatically alters the amount of gravity experienced by the planet on a weekly basis. 

The Sixteenth underwent a major apocalyptic event due to a war over artificial intelligence approximately three hundred years ago. Much of the landscape has already been reclaimed by the wilderness. Humanity lives in sparse communal settlements or in towering cities. This was once for communal protection from the wild, but the necessity of this has waned over time. Today, these cities contain [[Factions of the 16th|academics, criminals, authoritarians, and more]].

Touch The Sky is a Magic: The Gathering cube set on the Sixteenth. Magic has five colors of mana: white for justice, blue for intelligence, black for selfishness, red for impulsivness, and green for patience. Much of the Sixteenth's design is informed by the 'color pie', its inhabitants drawing mana mostly from the lands immediately surrounding them. The plains of the Sixteenth surround cities and outposts. Occultists live in compounds built in forests. Mountain fortresses are the birthplace of the Levinspeaker order.
