Robin Hood cowboy types. Often seen roaming the countryside looking for trouble, or making some if they don't find any. A caravan moves quickly across the plains of the Sixteenth, headed by Slofe. She admits anyone who can keep up with the caravan for a week straight, and exiles anyone who harms one of their own or who tells a lie. They are constantly skirmishing with Ferromancers.
