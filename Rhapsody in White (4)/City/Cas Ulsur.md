Located several leagues deep into the caverns of [[Ulsuria]], the underground labyrinthian city of Cas Ulsur is home to [[Ulsur Ghen|The Academy of Ulsur Ghen]]. Despite the rock walls of the cavern being a pale grey/blue, Cas Ulsur is bathed in a strong amber golden light, as it is rich in [[suralite]], an acidic yellow mineral akin to a mild sulfur. The water is undrinkable. The fog that gathers in the midday to afternoon posesses a strong smell and burns the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs of any who aren't yet accustomed to it, or shielding themselves from it by magical means.
