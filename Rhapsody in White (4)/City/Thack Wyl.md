Pronounced "thack wheel". It is a small, rustic village on the southern plains of [[Corelias Onum]], a half day's trek inland from the port town of [[Gherdt]]. With a population of around 150, most residents have some livestock that graze on the naturally abundant [[feather grass]], which some residents harvest and bundle for sale to the textile mills in Gherdt. Apocryphally founded by [[Wylia Ovell]] when they briefly inhabited the area.
